TODO

[ ] Update README
[ ] Make comm in code
[ ] Format output (log system)
[ ] Test and remove DEST_ERASE in each feature_recipe : cause problem when bundled in merge mode. But only for binary ? keep it for source?
[ ] Default build arch equivalent to current cpu arch ? (and change option name buildarch with forcearch)
[ ] Test and fix path with space
[ ] windows : function require
[ ] function get_ressource : change option STRIP to option NO_STRIP. STRIP will be by default if possible
[ ] windows : review link feature library and lib isolation
[ ] windows : portable mode review copy dependencies
[ ] windows lib : https://ryzomcore.atlassian.net/wiki/display/RC/MinGW+External+Libraries https://ryzomcore.atlassian.net/wiki/display/RC/Create+External+Libs
[ ] feature system : FEAT_DEFAULT_ARCH must be fill with current cpu arch
[ ] feature built from source must pick an arch and be installed in a folder with version@arch -- buildarch option should be remove -- by default built arch should be current cpu arch
[ ] replace gnu patch (pb with UAC)
[ ] linux : FORCE_RENAME on link feature library
[ ] windows : check library dynamic dependencies
[ ] linux & windows : when ckecking dependencies dynamic -- print all libs
[ ] add possibility of a last step before/after install, to do some test like make test or make check (i.e : for gmp lib)
