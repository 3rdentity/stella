TODO

[ ] Update README
[ ] Make commentary in code
[ ] Format output (log system)
[ ] Test and remove DEST_ERASE in each feature_recipe : cause problem when bundled in merge mode. But only for binary ? keep it for source? only when get binary

[ ] Test and fix path with space
[ ] windows : function require
[ ] function get_ressource : change option STRIP to option NO_STRIP. STRIP will be by default if possible
[ ] windows : review link feature library and lib isolation
[ ] windows : portable mode review copy dependencies
[ ] windows add recipes for these libs :

[ ] Default build arch equivalent to current cpu arch ? (and change option name buildarch with forcearch)
[ ] feature system : FEAT_DEFAULT_ARCH must be fill with current cpu arch
[ ] feature built from source must pick an arch and be installed in a folder with version@arch -- buildarch option should be remove -- by default built arch should be current cpu arch
[ ] windows : replace patch from gnuwin32 (pb with UAC)
[ ] linux : FORCE_RENAME on link_feature_library (see windows implementation)
[X] windows : check library dynamic dependencies - use dependencywalker in console mode ? use dumpbin http://stackoverflow.com/a/475323 ? use CMAKE GetPrerequisites. FINISH check_linked_lib.cmake use it with cmake -P check_linked_lib.cmake -DMY_BINARY_LOCATION=<path>
[ ] linux : when ckecking dependencies dynamic -- print all libs
[ ] add possibility of a last step before/after install, to do some test like make test or make check (i.e : for gmp lib)
[ ] windows : sys_install_vs2015community => this chocolatey recipe do not install all VC Tools by default
[ ] stella-env file : make it local or global with an option ?
[ ] "no_proxy" should be in stella-env file
[ ] proxy values in stella-env should be local or global
[X] windows : link-app : add option to align workspace/cache path (like on nix)

[ ] windows : build mingw-w64 compiler https://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds

[ ] ssh : launch stella app through ssh

SSHFS ? cache delivering only via HTTP ?

[ ] win : harmonization of internal recipe (patch, unzip, wget, ...)
