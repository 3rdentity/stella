TODO

[ ] Update README
[ ] Make comm in code
[ ] Format output (log system)
[ ] Test and remove DEST_ERASE in each feature_recipe : cause problem when bundled in merge mode. But only for binary ? keep it for source? only when get binary

[ ] Test and fix path with space
[ ] windows : function require
[ ] function get_ressource : change option STRIP to option NO_STRIP. STRIP will be by default if possible
[ ] windows : review link feature library and lib isolation
[ ] windows : portable mode review copy dependencies
[ ] windows add recipes for these libs : https://ryzomcore.atlassian.net/wiki/display/RC/MinGW+External+Libraries https://ryzomcore.atlassian.net/wiki/display/RC/Create+External+Libs

[ ] Default build arch equivalent to current cpu arch ? (and change option name buildarch with forcearch)
[ ] feature system : FEAT_DEFAULT_ARCH must be fill with current cpu arch
[ ] feature built from source must pick an arch and be installed in a folder with version@arch -- buildarch option should be remove -- by default built arch should be current cpu arch
[ ] windows : replace patch from gnuwin32 (pb with UAC)
[ ] linux : FORCE_RENAME on link feature library
[X] windows : check library dynamic dependencies - use dependencywalker in console mode ? use dumpbin http://stackoverflow.com/a/475323 ? use CMAKE GetPrerequisites. FINISH check_linked_lib.cmake use it with cmake -P check_linked_lib.cmake -DMY_BINARY_LOCATION=<path>
[ ] linux : when ckecking dependencies dynamic -- print all libs
[ ] add possibility of a last step before/after install, to do some test like make test or make check (i.e : for gmp lib)
[ ] windows : sys_install_vs2015community => this chocolatey recipe do not install all VC Tools by default
[ ] stella-env file : make it local or global with an option ?
[ ] no_proxy should be in stella-env file like proxy. ANd should be local or global
[X] windows : link-app : add option to align workspace/cache path (like on nix)
